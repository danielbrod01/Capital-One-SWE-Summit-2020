# Capital One Software Engineering Summit MindSumo Challenge 2020
<a href="https://danielbrod01.github.io/restaurant/index.html">My Web Application Submission</a>
for the final round of the application for Capital One's Software Engineering Summit. JavaScript/jQuery web app that allows you to decide good restaurants around them.

Website: https://danielbrod01.github.io/restaurant/index.html

The web app is not supported well on mobile devices. Request to see "Desktop Site" on the browser as it will provide a better user experience. 

It is advised that when prompted, you **allow** my web page to *access your geolocation* for appropriate search results to appear. It will default to San Francisco, CA as its location when geolocation access is blocked by the user.

# Project Details
This web application functions as an information service to good restaurants near you. Detailed below lists the technologies and tools used in the app.

*Note: The Yelp Fusion API key used in my js files are mine, but I am not familiar with using environment variables so do let me know if you have an idea as to how. Otherwise if cloning this repo and choosing to run it locally, you must register for an API key <a href="https://www.yelp.com/fusion">here</a>.*
